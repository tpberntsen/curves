    """
    Creates a smooth interpolated curve from a collection of commodity forward/swap/futures prices using hyperbolic tension spline algorithm.

    Generally this function is used to increase the granularity of a curve from a collection of forward prices.
    The resulting curve will be smooth, and of homogenous granularity. For example a smooth monthly curve can be
    created from a collection of monthly, quarterly and season granularity forward market prices. This algorithm also
    handles input contracts with overlapping delivery periods, i.e. the bootstrapping step of forward curve construction.

    Args:
        contracts (pd.Series or iterable): The input contracts to be interpolated.
            If iterable of tuples, with each tuple describing a forward delivery period and price in one
            of the following forms:
                ([period], [price])
                ([period start], [period end], [price])
                (([period start], [period end]), [price])
            Where:
                [price] is a float, being the price of commodity delivered over the delivery period.
                [period] specifies the delivery period.
                [period start] specifies the start of the contract delivery period.
                [period end] specifies the inclusive end of the contract delivery period.
            [period], [period start] and [period end] can be any of the following types:
                str
                pandas.Period
                pandas.Timestamp
                date
                datetime
            The delivery periods of all input contracts can be contiguous, overlapping or have gaps. If there are
            overlaps then the spline_knots argument must be provided.
        freq (str): Describes the granularity of curve being constructed using pandas Offset Alias notation.
        tension (float or callable): parameter which specifies the "tension" TODO complete this
            A higher tension value makes the curve less smooth, and closer to piecewise linear function.
        discount_factor (callable, optional): Callable which maps from delivery period to the discount factor for the settlement
            date of this period. This function will be called with an argument of either pandas Period or Timestamp to
            describe the delivery period, at the granularity of the interpolated curve. The discount factor is necessary
            as a no-arbitrage forward price should equal weighted average of it's constituent delivery period forward prices,
            with the weighting being the product of the discount factor and the delivery volume. If omitted, defaults to None, in
            which case a discount factor of 1.0 will be used for all delivery periods, as is suitable for futures.
        average_weight (callable, optional): Mapping from pandas Period or Timestamp instances to float which describes the weighting
            that each forward period contributes to a price for delivery which spans multiple periods. The
            parameter will be at the granularity of the interpolated curve, as specified by the freq argument. An example of such weighting is
            a monthly curve (freq='M') of a commodity which delivers on every calendar day. In this example average_weight would be
            a callable which returns the number of calendar days in the month, e.g.:
                lambda p: p.asfreq('D', 'e').day
            Defaults to None, in which case each period has equal weighting.
        mult_season_adjust (callable, optional): Callable with single parameter of type pandas Period or Timestamp and return type float.
            If this argument is supplied, the value from the underlying spline function is multiplied by the result of mult_season_adjust,
            evaluated for each index period in the resulting curve.
        add_season_adjust (callable, optional): Callable with single parameter of type pandas Period or Timestamp and return type float.
            If this argument is supplied, the value from the underlying spline function has the result of add_season_adjust,
            evaluated for each index period, added to it to derive each price in the resulting curve.
        shaping_ratios (iterable, optional): iterable of tuples, with each tuple describing a constraint on the ratio
            between the prices of different periods on the derived forward curve in the form:
                ([numerator period], [denominator period], [ratio])
            Where:
                [numerator period] is the delivery period corresponding to the numerator part of the ratio.
                [denominator period] is the delivery period corresponding to the denomintor part of the ratio.
                [ratio] (float) is the ratio between the forward prices.
            [numerator period] and [denominator period] can be any of the following types:
                str
                pandas.Period
                date
                datetime
                A 2-tuple of any of the above three types, with the elements specifying the period start and end respectively.
        shaping_spreads (iterable, optional): iterable of tuples, with each tuple describing a constraint on the spread
            between the prices of different periods on the derived forward curve in the form:
                ([period long], [period short], [spread])
            Where:
                [period long] is the delivery period for the long part of the spread.
                [period short] is the delivery period for the short part of the spread.
                [spread] (float) is the spread between the forward prices.
            [period long] and [period short] can be any of the following types:
                str
                pandas.Period
                date
                datetime
                A 2-tuple of any of the above three types, with the elements specifying the period start and end respectively.
        time_zone (str, pytz.timezone or dateutil.tz.tzfile, optional): Time zone applicable for the delivery periods of
            the interpolated curve. This should be specified if interpolating to higher than daily granularity (e.g. hourly)
            as time zone information is necessary to determine lost or gain hours due to clock changes. If omitted,
            defaults to UTC-like behaviour with no clock changes. It is not advisable to specify time_zone if
            interpolating to daily or lower granularity.
        knots (iterable, KnotPositions, optional): If an iterable, the internal knots of the spline constructed,
            i.e. the points in time which serve as boundaries between the piecewise hyperbolic functions.
            Can also be an instance of the KnotPositions flag enum, which provides a convenient way of specifying knots relative
            to the boundaries of the input contracts. If omitted, defaults to KnotPositions.CONTRACT_START_AND_END, in which case the
            start period and end period + 1 of each input contract are used as the internal knots.
        front_1st_deriv (float, optional): Constraint specifying what the first derivative of the spline at the very start of the
            curve must be. If this parameter is omitted no constraint is applied.
        back_1st_deriv (float, optional): Constraint specifying what the first derivative of the spline at the end of the
            curve must be. If this parameter is omitted no constraint is applied.
        return_spline_coeff (bool, optional): Flag to determine whether the solved spline coefficients should be returned as the second
            element in a 2-tuple. Defaults to False if omitted.

    Returns:
        Either pandas.Series, or 2-tuple of (pandas.Series, pandas.DataFrame) if return_spline_coeff argument is True.
        In either case the pandas.Series is a smooth contiguous curve with values consistent with prices within the contracts parameter.
        This pandas.Series will have an index of type PeriodIndex or DatetimeIndex (if caller provides time_zone)
        and freq equal to the freq parameter.
        If return_spline_coeff is True a 2-tuple will be returned with the 2nd element being a pandas.DataFrame containing
        the solved spline coefficients solved z_i and y_i at each spline knot.

    Notes:
        Whether time_zone is provided by the caller determines whether pandas Period or Timestamp type is used to
        represent delivery periods in the returned data and as an argument when calling callable arguments. If time_zone is not specified
        then pandas.Period type is used, as instances of Period are not time zone aware type. If time_zone is specified pandas.Timestamp
        type is as used, with the tz property of instances being set accordingly.
